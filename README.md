**MenuControl – Solitaire Staff Panel**

 **Project Overview**<br>
MenuControl – Solitaire Staff Panel is a focused, full-stack web application designed to help hotel staff manage and maintain food menu items in a structured and user-friendly interface.
<br>
This project simulates the internal staff-side component of a larger hotel dining management system. While hotel in-room dining systems often include order handling, guest interfaces, and payment modules, 
this project specifically delivers the core menu control functionality – allowing staff to perform full CRUD operations on menu items.
<br>
 **Project Scope**<br>

My project's initial objective was to build a complete **Hotel Management Application** that would serve both employees and the guests. The planned features included a login page with 2 options : Staff and Guests ;leading each user to their dedicated interfaces.For the guest side , the interface was intended to support food order creation, view items , update their order ( for example: changing the quantity of specific item like reducing  two cokes to one) and order deletion.<br>
However, due to limited time and project scope , I focused more on building the staff interface for the current version ; the login page and the guest interface were excluded from the current version .<br>
This allowed me to concentrate on building the core system functionalities for staff before expanding onto guest side.
<br>
The project enables hotel staff to:<br>
1. Add new food items to the menu
2. View all available menu items
3. Edit existing food items
4. Delete menu items
   
**Features**
1. Grid-based layout for displaying food items
2. Stylish card design with hover effects
3. Form-based item creation and editing
4. Data stored in a JSON file to simulate a database
5. RESTful backend using Express.js

**Technologies Used**
**Frontend:**
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript

**Backend:**
