**MenuControl – Solitaire Staff Panel**

 **Project Overview**<br>
MenuControl – Solitaire Staff Panel is a focused, full-stack web application designed to help hotel staff manage and maintain food menu items in a structured and user-friendly interface.
<br>
This project simulates the internal staff-side component of a larger hotel dining management system. While hotel in-room dining systems often include order handling, guest interfaces, and payment modules, 
this project specifically delivers the core menu control functionality – allowing staff to perform full CRUD operations on menu items.
<br>
 **Project Scope**<br>

Due to limited time and the need to submit a complete and working full-stack application, the scope has been narrowed down to a **staff-only module** that handles menu management. 
This system can serve as the foundation or backend for a larger in-room dining system in the future.
<br>
The project enables hotel staff to:<br>
1. Add new food items to the menu
2. View all available menu items
3. Edit existing food items
4. Delete menu items
   
**Features**
1. Grid-based layout for displaying food items
2. Stylish card design with hover effects
3. Form-based item creation and editing
4. Data stored in a JSON file to simulate a database
5. RESTful backend using Express.js

**Technologies Used**
**Frontend:**
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript

**Backend:**
1. Node.js
2. Express.js

**Data Storage:**

**Future Improvemenets:**

3.Enable image uploads for menu items
4.Add category-based filtering
